# git gud lesson plan

## motivation

 - most students (especially in sutd), learn git through github
   - its "that place we store our projects"
   - rather than "that version control tool so we can fix stuff if it breaks"
 - students just memorise the commands and when something breaks, can't easily fix it
   - heck even i'm still not confident in fixing stuff i break
 - design decisions informed by the backend are abstracted to the cl in strange ways
   - no one knows what diff, bisect, reflog, etc. do
 - this course is an attempt to (1) teach git and (2) bridge the gap in knowledge

## lesson plan

 - what is git?
   - what git can do
   - what it's used for
   - why use git (or like any vcs)
 - how does git work?
   - <s>stolen</s> heavily inspired by the git parable by tom preston-werner
     - snapshots
     - branches
     - distributed development
     - changing history, staging, & diffing
     - saving space (tbc)
   - this part does not cover commands; it's an introduction to git concepts
 - how can we use git?
 - where to from here?
   - alternative vcs?
   - git repository hosting platforms
   - various other git commands
   - recommendation for further reading
